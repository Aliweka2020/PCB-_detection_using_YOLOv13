# PCB-_detection_using_YOLOv13

Automated printed circuit board (PCB) defect identification has grown in importance in the current electronics manufacturing industry, where speed and accuracy are crucial for maintaining product quality and cutting expenses. Real-time defect localization is made possible by deep learning, especially object identification algorithms, which also reduce human error. In order to overcome the shortcomings in generalizability, robustness, and adaptability to unknown fault kinds, this work utilize the recent light-weight object detection model -YOLOv13- for auto-detection for PCB defects. The model was trained using a three-fold cross-validation approach, outperforms current state-of-the-art models with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 98.4% while keeping a lightweight structure with just 2.2 million parameters. These findings demonstrate YOLOv13's potential for high-precision, real-time PCB fault identification in industrial settings, providing a workable and effective solution for smart production settings
